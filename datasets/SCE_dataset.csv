subtle corner case where same shuffle output address might get re used while reading code today i discovered possible way shuffle output address could get re used in pathological circumstances described in 70 last player advantage basically other clients give up on shuffle go back their queue if things line up in improbable but still possible way another shuffle can get set up use output address of failed shuffle described in 70 shuffle eventually broadcasts by lagged player thus 2 outputs 1 possibly being unshuffled change other shuffled non change can end up on same address after all said done unlikely but there needs workaround or fix for i have already thought of strategy address imposing cooling down period before re using addresses of previously failed shuffles just in case they eventually succeed are broadcast by lagged player requires little additional logic added but its not too bad i consider high priority as corner case while unlikely may pop up occasionally reduce confidence in quality of software if people get wind of,0

better handling of private public nonces with private transactions problem was first identified on 571 given private transaction has its own nonce relative sender account withing privacy group pmt has its own nonce relative account creating pmt things can get messy simplest scenario following account x has private nonce 0 in privacy group p account x has public nonce 0 in public world user send privtx1 sender x nonce 0 privtx2 sender x nonce 1 when creating pmt we check for pending txs in pool however things happen asynchronously so when creating second pmt first one might not in pool yet so we might end up with pmt1 privtx1 sender x nonce 0 pmt2 privtx2 sender x nonce 0 lead failure of second pmt even worse depending on order transactions reach client we might end up with pmt1 privtx1 sender x nonce 1 pmt2 privtx2 sender x nonce 0 cause pmts succeed but underlying private transaction executed in wrong order fail we have identified workaround using priv distributerawtransaction eth sendrawtransaction have control over private public nonces being used however hard work would good if we could come up with alternative example of using web3js eea do,1
