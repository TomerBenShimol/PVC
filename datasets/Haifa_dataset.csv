from wikipedia page government arguing sunken costs necessity for government interception transitioning from bluetrace enf presented several issues most notably as app cannot run both protocols simultaneously 107 any protocol change would hard cut between versions would result in app no longer functioning for any users who had not yet updated enf of app additionally two protocols are almost completely incompatible 81 80 meaning vast majority all but ui of covidsafe app would have redeveloped similarly because of change from centralised reporting mechanism decentralised one very little of existing server software would usable 108 role of state territory health authorities in process would also change significantly as they would no longer responsible for determining contacting encounters 108 change would involve retraining health officials penning new agreements with states territories up until at least 18 june 2020 dta was experimenting with enf 109 however in interview with project held on 28 june 2020 deputy chief medical officer dr nick coatsworth stated covidsafe would absolutely not transition enf 110 he reasoned government would never transition any contact tracing solution without human in loop reporting 111 112 something no decentralised protocol can support how likely we see issue resolved as seems closer never than probably,0
covidsafe support i noticed code for v1 8 was published today became available in app store short while later although code in centralcontroller has changed i do not believe issue fixed re iterate wabzqems quote from documentation attempts connect peripheral don t time out ref additionally didfailtoconnect event only called if transient error occurred during connection so cleaning up there doesnt help apples documentation says manager invokes method when connection initiated with connect options method fails complete because connection attempts dont time out failed connection usually indicates transient issue in which case you may attempt connecting peripheral again ref so its not clear how new code can fix issue but just really sure i used almost same scenario described in my earlier post but with covidsafe rather than nrf connect on test phone carefully shielded from out of range of other devices with empty payloads i have fake covidsafe peripheral changes its mac after every connection after 200 connections became unable make further connections other apps similarly become unable connect other devices terminating relaunching covidsafe or turning off on bluetooth made resume was able reproduce several times on one occasion i let stay in stuck state for over 45 minutes was not able recover on its own i suggest adding some sort of timeout any locations in code call connectperipheral wabzqem do you have suggestion on best way implement,0
hi jimmo thanks for issue report actually issue we picked up in internal testing not long before you posted we are currently working on fix well keep issue open track progress let you know when we believe we have released fix,0
hi c19x just clarify i should have said shutting down relaunching covidsafe immediately restores heart monitor connections not restarting although restarting iphone also works we also note toggling bluetooth off on in system settings did not help,0
we also concur with wabzqem covidsafe consuming limited bluetooth resources unnecessarily when attempts reconnect with peripherals other covidsafe instances are history when our fitness app cannot connect bluetooth heart monitors logs show waiting for didconnect callbacks from central simply shutting down restarting covidsafe immediately restores heart monitor connections we have verified numerous times in home office where covidsafe should definitely not have pending connections centralcontroller swift line239 surely bug would also limiting covidsafes performance effectiveness perhaps you could simply timeout pending connections as we do,0
almost certainly cause of covidsafe causing some maybe not all issues with connections apple watch other devices i noticed device disconnects occurring more frequently when 1 2 was released when bug was introduced but assumed was because app was connecting more as first background bug was fixed now i realise its probably because bug was introduced at same time with assumption based on what wabzqem describing above covidsafe ending up in state where has lots of in progress pending connections i was able make demo using two popular ble scanner apps nrf connect ble scanner could show how explains commonly reported issue covidsafe interfering with other devices using whatever means make nrf connect find 100s of devices e g device changes its mac every second or something initiate connection each of them each device stuck in pending state assumed same as what covidsafe doing as described above try connect different device from ble scanner past some number of pending connections in nrf connect ble scanner unable connect force quit nrf connect ble scanner immediately able connect other device,0
hi wabzqem thank you for bringing our attention were currently looking into update issue when we have more information,0
i came exactly same conclusion as jimmo after reading diff i dont believe issue fixed i would recommend keeping track of peripherals are being connected with connect peripheral cbperipheral options string any = nil remove from set when centralmanager central cbcentralmanager didconnect peripheral cbperipheral called then explicitly cancel remove any connections have been in set for too long you may need use other bluetooth callbacks trigger cancellations as doing in background otherwise may tricky comment in diddisconnectperipheral error may represent peripheral out of range bl off etc in case we dont want retry probably misguided as soon as exchange made peripheral quickly disconnected so run with nil error function wont run when pending connection peripheral out of range as its never connected begin with,0

you use bluetooth track their unique id so then you can trace back who they have been in contact with so just make when you scan qr code literally just inserts new record you have been in contact with venue same as if bluetooth tacked theres no law changing or anything needs happen just build feature move on most people would like if not then they wont have use potential downside someone who dislikes app or wants cause trouble can ddos contact database by sharing qr codes on internet so they can scanned without actually visiting venue why i think qr code should not directly related contact tracing function why i propose use qr codes for something more more benign such as proof of authenticity of app,0
dear rizidis you are entirely correct pending connects serve limited purpose for reconnecting ios central ios peripheral if devices are not reconnected within few minutes as ios peripheral referenced under new peripheral identifier after about 20 30 minutes of being idle i e going out of range same also true for android peripherals albeit period usually longer indefinite pending connect only meaningful for ios central reconnect devices with fixed identifier like door lock example in apple doc regular housekeeping remove pending connections have been inactive for some time good idea not entirely sure why these pending connections are impacting your fitness app tho would shutting down covidsafe not restarting restore your apps connections or does have include restart,0

dear covidsafe ive created solution supports constant background scanning device proximity tracking on ios android solution does not rely on keeping iphone unlock using black screen reduce power usage acts like ordinary app where user can background app use other apps lock phone indefinitely while continues detect track other beacons contact tracing app work on 81 56 of devices globally without software upgrade latest does not rely on google + apple api as i fear many users wont or cant upgrade their os thus only work on theoretical maximum of 76 98 of devices today bluetooth beacon underpinning solution work on 98 74 of devices globally june 2020 can even handle android devices can only act as central not peripheral e g samsung j6 please take look at scan connect read disconnect pendingconnect|scan approach in covidsafe on ios fail when both devices are in background state i e app not in foreground device locked which norm they simply wont detect each other until one of them comes foreground try following failure condition 1 iphone b in separate faraday bags i e out of range of each other take out install start app on move app background lock device place back in faraday bag take b out install start app on b move app background lock device place back in faraday bag wait 30 minutes equivalent two isolated users installing their app venturing out later take b out they wont detect each other until either or b brings app foreground failure condition 2 6 continuing from 5 now b are together detecting each other 7 move app on b background lock devices place in faraday bag 8 wait 30 minutes equivalent two people meeting then going out of range of each other for while 9 take out of faraday bag they wont detect each other until either or b brings app foreground other related issues have been investigated solution has been developed documented for sharing please take look at best regards good luck,0
for venues are currently require customers record contact details in log book for visit its reasonable give exemption for people who have app installed doing way does not contravene law probably only requires change in regulation of relevant state qr code should only identify software as being legitimate not fake screenshot perhaps also of software should not contain any information identifies user,0
i often have problems connecting my bluetooth heart rate monitor my iphone apps polar beat garmin connect normally resolved by closing covidsafe not great scenario given times im using my heartrate monitor when im leaving house should running covidsafe,0

just say same issue manifests slightly differently on my pixel 3a when screen locked bottom notification from other apps obscured irrespective of how many there are eg if there only one notification its obscured or second of two etc small icon shows at bottom of drawer when its being pulled up as saalkom described no covidsafe notification shows when screen unlocked covidsafe icon shows in notification bar when phone unlocked like all my other notifications but no actual notification shows when i pull down drawer when phone unlocked small icon behaves same as when locked edit update just clarifying as with others whove described these issues only occur when bluetooth enabled when bluetooth disabled everything normal covidsafe notification shows in app drawer when unlocked on lock screen all other notifications display normally ive attached couple of screenshots of notifications being obscured as displays differently others who have posted,0
possibly probably effect of same underlying issue when active covidsafe 1 0 33 breaks display of other apps notifications on lockscreen in samsung oneui 1 0 under android 9 pie on my galaxy s8+ sm g955f normally maximum of three notifications appear on lockscreen in their usual form any extra notifications appear below them minimized so they appear only as icons see screenshot below for example of five notifications on lockscreen including covidsafe when bluetooth off but now when covidsafe 1 0 33 active of 1 3 unminimized notifications only some  if any at all of text of bottom notification or of only notification as case may appears which different merely being minimized iconified as notification title where applicable subtitle does sometimes appear just without any notification content notifications with media controls do appear but only partially none of minimized iconified notifications if applicable appear below 3 unminimized notifications at all sometimes not even icon of one of notificationstheoretically arent even minimized iconified displayed so notification becomes totally invisible but location where icon should can still tapped shown in expanded form in notification drawer green covidsafe active notification no longer directly visible in any form on lockscreen which change i personally appreciate for decreased clutter but which id also put good money on being culprit behind mess see below screenshots for example of what should four non covidsafe notifications on lockscreen except do not disturb notification missing as well as example of what lockscreen looks like when media player app only non covidsafe notification not have been dismissed both screenshots were taken after bluetooth was enabled note my email address no longer displayed in gmail notification i like very specific side effect actually but im just using notifications from gmail as example  happens with all apps nb i choose hide content of notifications from messages on lockscreen when device still locked but icon of brokennotification tapped expand its invisible contents full notification drawer notifications appear as normal all well in world green covidsafe active notification appears only as small icon left of notification settings clear notifications buttons at bottom of drawer which again if intentional behaviour personally appreciated although sometimes its only visible while pulling notification drawer up dismiss drawer if bears mentioning at all for any reason when device unlocked green covidsafe active notification icon visible in statusbar although again apparently absent from notification drawer itself unless you pull drawer back up  i presume too mostly intentional so once more its appreciated i hope bug can fixed without completely undoing these desirable changes,0
hi jimmo thank you for bringing our attention backlog task has been created look into we update github issue if we have progress report or need any clarification,0
thank you i just want there public trust in app so contact tracing effort isnt hindered,0
in subject of needing improve explanations i initially installed app registered then disabled its access internet on assumption was only legitimately needed for registration infection notification i subsequently heard something about needing fetch new keys periodically but no explanation of why was necessary both in terms of how they are used in terms of why was decided adopt design works in way including any tradeoffs were considered or could considered post hoc,0

thaidn after some further digging discussions with jimmo were not sure just updating tink sufficient we were wondering why reports in indicated update androidx security 1 0 0 rc 2 seemed trigger more occurrences of issue update adds support for masterkey deprecates create method in encryptedsharedpreferences uses masterkeyalias in favour of one accepts masterkey masterkeys masterkey both directly access androidkeystore without using tink as such tests introduced in tink catch problems with accessing androidkeystore wont help in those two classes as such wont prevent creation of new master keys when there problem with accessing androidkeystore from covidsafe point of view call masterkeys val masterkeyalias = masterkeys getorcreate masterkeys aes256 gcm spec in preference kt even necessary wouldnt tinks androidkeysetmanager perform same actions but with added checks for issues accessing androidkeystore seems might better not use masterkeys only access through tink benefit from additional checks in 1 4 0 covidsafe also probably need update preference kt handle occasional failure access androidkeystore apply random back off retry,0

its unclear whether explains why appears related app updates but potentially whats happening every on tempid fetch i e call getencrypterjtwtoken has chance see transient keystore error therefore replace key if happens while app backgrounded then crash without user noticing means auto update can now happen as app not running user then notices when they first re open app see crash since 1 0 48 tempid now happens 24x less often daily so rate of incidence of issue might fall,0

ok repharase make sure i understand correctly you would prefer use mailing list over single users email for login guard against single user losing access so whole organization losing access but you would prefer password only login over mailing list because access password vault easier guard than access mailing list if thats accurate how about create dedicated email address own account for example admin myorg com store credentials for email address in password vault make logging into io easier also set password on account store password in vault too how does sound just for reference in case its useful heres what i currently do when i get requests restore lost access say employee leaves company their colleague wants take over company account in these cases i contact former employee get their consent transfer ownership if thats not possible but new colleague 1 has same company specific email domain 2 already team member thats good enough too i transfer ownership,0

cuu508 while i have you im sorting out deployment do you have any recommendations for handling sendalerts in production i havent been able find any examples of how was done as i tried inside venv but i noticed ran only when i had venv activated we are really enjoying app its changing way we view future deployments idea of doing these django venv style apps them being stand alone really making us think about our traditional html php only use of our web server,0
i have pretty solid production setup running on aws now using few tools on my front end server im using nginx reverse proxy force all connections ssl then nginx using proxy pass statement forwards hack haproxy haproxy doing round robin load balancing two ubuntu nodes on port 8100 supervisior installed on both nodes run manage runserver 0 0 0 0 8100 on both nodes nodes are both part of glusterfs cluster which mounted opt apps where i have healthcheck installed so both servers see exact same files all time i have healthcheck set use mysql backend set localhost port 3307 on both servers both servers run mariadb on port 3306 with maxscale in front of provide database load balancing failover healtcheck sendalerts only runs on single node also managed by supervisor backups are handled by bash scripts dumps compresses database makes tarball of entire opt apps directory moves s3 filesystem mounted mnt backups which mounted using s3fs on cron job at 1am once week cronjob runs at 1 30 am run prunepings keep my db size small same job uses find command find files older than 30 days old delete any werent created on 1st 7th 14th 21st or 28th of month leaving me with daily backups for 1 month weekly backups for everything after its little bit of kludge cobbled together pile of utils software but its all open source all free works like charm ive got full redundant load balanced active active servers with exception of sendalerts only runs on single node but maybe in future there should way mark alerts pending for send then mark them as sent or something so you could have sendalerts start with random delay of 10 40 seconds so two instances of could running at same time maybe even have them use table in database check in once minute balance each other out so each one runs every other minute or something like,0

hey cuu508 we did seem have missed uuid thats generated for each check we have fixed expected flow when check goes down if no existing incident found in either triggered or acknowledged state for given uuid then new incident created alerts are sent if incident found in triggered or acknowledged state then we append events without sending any alert when check goes up if no existing incident found in either triggered or acknowledged state for given uuid then we ignore instead of creating new incident if incident found in triggered or acknowledged state then we auto resolve incident thanks for all help being so kind about also thanks noob master147 for creating spike sh integration,0
sweet i already retroactively see change in logic something i just considered i dont expect need use but should job ever radically become faster in execution time i decrease grace time older ones with longer grace times may disappear if grace time not persistent data associated with particular execution of job would true if its being stored as high level property or descriptive attribute of job applies every runtime of job past present future i dont know if case or not as i havent read through code very thoroughly storing current grace time value at time of execution if not already being done along with job execution results would address i mention only as consideration as i know increase complexity i dont see urgency its more like one of those back of mind quirks you know about,0

im hoping with each project having its own integrations people have manually toggle them on off less often im literally in process of finally sending checks slack because they are now project based excellent ill sleep on do some experimenting more i think about i really just want aware of any downed checks regardless of project anyone using service knows anxiety of not having absolute at glance insight into their operations landing page could indicate up down states in each block perhaps some kind of indicator over logo would indicate there are n checks down in other projects im just spitballing here long list of all projects la pre projects combined not necessarily what i think best approach yeah im aware of had do ton of clicking myself too move few dozens of checks around not too enthusiastic about implementing batch editing feature though would niche one time use feature but complex implement both on client server side i hear you really only useful for those who are now going leverage projects,0

fantastic ive just created two additional projects plus renamed original default one pre dated projects if i understand right i would need create new api key for new project re authenticate with whatever integration i previously had right additionally theres no need adjust any of crons etc because endpoint id remains same during transfer one thing i immediately desire i would also want high level overview of all project checks given projects help owner organizing permissions i think anyone who has access multiple projects should have option when clicking on logo seeing project blocks view all of them together landing page behind logo would serve as good dashboard of sorts could summarize up down states etc in my case there are three distinct technology departments im responsible for one department storefront another system another warehouse as technology owner i maybe want see high level overview with red tags indicating something down members of my other teams would want their distinct technology access finally there may someone immediately below me who would have access two of those three projects i guess ultimately i dont necessarily need see all checks in one long list but having some ui indication another project has downed checks when im in another would helpful for those at glance situations i like direction youve taken with projects opens up some nice possibilities edit now ive begun transferring checks other projects im finding process bit involved would nice able bulk select multiple checks choose transfer them all at once im certain you already know though edit2 ive transferred all relevant checks integrated pusover notifications but now im wondering if pushover able integrate with all of them at once on pushover site i dont see subscription for each project i just see single subscription i dont know if its just because thats how lays them out but now im curious edit3 i tested my question from edit2 pushover does work for all three projects nice,0

thanks for suggestion i understand problem idea of adding nonces distinguish overlapping start finish pairs two problems with would not trivial implement efficiently as advanced feature weaving into current everything simple ux would tricky generally id like do one thing ok couple things do well use notify when expected event didnt happen dont use for generic logging or metrics collection in celery scenario i would look into monitoring celery process using does system process exist has processed any jobs recently collecting metrics from individual job executions using log collector elk stack splunk papertrail logdna loggly etc etc another idea consider i know few io customers are using api create short lived checks for each build or deploy when job starts they create new check via api clean up when job finishes,0

thanks for extra details author of original ticket using apache + mod wsgi in setup mod wsgi sets script name environment variable with url prefix django knows about variable handles things automatically takes url prefix in account when resolving urls adds prefix when generating urls thing i needed fix there was making sure url prefix also used whenever url generated in javascript  there were few such places templates dont use hardcoded urls start with as i understand different situation because were not using cgi like interface we are using reverse proxy reverse proxy does not set script name variable so django doesnt handle urls correctly i think problem not specific you would run into same issue with any django app or possibly any wsgi app i think fix use djangos force script name setting as experiment i set up nginx site like so server location foo static alias path static collected location foo proxy pass in local settings py i added force script name = foo static url = foo static with i had site running at was with development server not with uwsgi linuxservers dockerfile uses now im not sure whats least painful way get your stack do something similar you would need way set force script name static url settings you might also need tweak static map bit in uwsgi ini,0

still trying wrap my head around some clarifying questions i did change down up did you do through django admin or some other way just changes back null again do you reckon was done by sendalerts i e did switch back null instantly or minute or so later seems something weird with 1 minute 1 minute configuration only check with configuration also only check having issue once i switch in django admin site everything goes back normal so if you update status in django admin doesnt flip back null any more on v1 7 0 seems reflect its status properly now did you get problematic check fixed permanenlty before upgrading v1 7 0 or only after,0

great i was going suggest look at flip model few suggestions on naming status field has string values history status fields have numeric values breaks consistency perhaps we could use up 0 up 1 fields similar prometheus endpoints output history= parameter isnt very descriptive history of what perhaps rename flip log= would leave space for including e g ping log= in future history parameter accepts values like 6h 2d 1w they look good but perhaps in initial implementation we can use simple number of seconds instead plain number of seconds would easier validate i think current implementation would crash with history=abcd for example consistent with other api calls use number of seconds for timeout grace putting together how about get api v1 checks flip log=3600 name my first check copy tags desc grace 3600 n pings 1 status down last ping 2020 03 23t23 30 18+00 00 next ping null flips timestamp 2020 03 23t23 30 18 767z up 1 timestamp 2020 03 25t00 30 18 767z up 0 unique key e855898bebff1756cde7c571319d877d07a38dab timeout 86400,0
cuu508 your latest comment along right line i think as application developer you decide what metrics are useful expose about your application each one of those then becomes metric with name of your choosing but metrics wouldnt change depending on what checks are configured metric can have multiple labels so instead of just hc status label= opt backups 0 you could have hc status name= opt backups tags= sandbox unique key= 8ae6264ea885d3e2c8ea63b7470858e97281cfaf 0 could used disambiguate checks with same name you should only use labels for properties of check dont change because if you change label values for check prometheus treats as completely fresh time series also labels have cost in prometheus so not everything should label think of them like indexes in relational database i e primarily for filtering rather than conveying information when exporting checks status what data type should we use use gauge 0=down 1=up i agree gauge appropriate here do we report status of each tag as well not all metrics need have same labels so you could have metric like tag status tag= foo 1 do we report project wide totals like num checks num checks down sounds reasonable though metrics label naming guide suggests checks up total checks down total might better names,0

out of interest in what cases would you want sort order arbitrary specified manually i would probably never want sorting arbitrary as they are currently theyre sorted by order in which theyre defined which good default sorting by name would most useful for me but if task of adding sorting any number of headings once problem solved initially becomes trivial i would probably sort by last ping from time time just because i could ultimately though i think sorting by name would biggest quality of life win for me requesting ability sort by name has really grown out of increase in number of checks i now have 31 as youve mentioned gets chaotic after while especially when you think of new check have some mild ocd would prefer placing check alongside or injected between two other checks for example i recently added schedule for resizing our application group instances based on day of week hours of day i have three base rules run every day then more specific rules run from sunday saturday in describing these checks you ive described them in meaningful order unfortunately i didnt define them in precisely order so days of week are not in order nor are general rules run daily schedule grew organically for example being able sort by their name or some other property makes customizing order possible would restore order make easier skim would for grouping checks together by their project host system role i use tags group by type of checks but even if i just selected tag group most checks would out of order because of organic nature of creating new checks,0

even in my production system one check sits there with no status in thats culprit here if you manually changed say down in production database im pretty sure issues would go away but obvious question of course how ended up with blank null status in first place im not sure how could have happened how old check has received any pings if you have database backups would possible look at backups pin down time when went from valid status null,0

thanks for suggestion generally id like keep service focused on dead mans switch style monitoring not move too far into generic logging direction but its possible we could do something here if you dont need alerted about warn state how would you ideally want information displayed would you periodically looking over logs when sending pings you can already send post requests put arbitrary information up 10k per ping in payload you can click on entries in log listing opens ping details dialog with all details including post body admittedly for routine checking would not convenient use,0

im wondering if mysql server has gone away happens because of connection being idle for too long did you also see similar errors when running manage py sendalerts sendalerts similar in also management command also doesnt do anything special with connection handling but runs queries every few seconds,0
muff1nman what specific scenarios external factors are you thinking of im thinking of three classes of problems manage py sendalerts gets unexpected http status code or timeout back when sending alert when happens retries 3 times with no delay if still no success logs error manage py sendalerts gets interrupted while sending alert could crash due code bug system killing process or whole system freezing or crashing when happens no retries are made no error logged manage py sendalerts delivers alert payload remote system e g gets 200 ok back from pagerduty api but alert lost further down chain id like have better handling of second case its been at back of my mind but have not yet tackled first case im not sure about would nice have things like exponential backoff more than 3 retries for webhook integrations but we also dont want 1 races between several notifications about same check 2 too many spawned threads 3 sendalerts process clogging up third case id like leave alone once alert handed over remote system has acknowledged over our job done,0

i have now added auto refresh feature my checks page you can try out on updated pieces are status icons for each check last ping field other fields are not touched so for example if you rename check in another browser window name not update on your first browser window update frequency every 3 seconds changes every 60 seconds if user inactive for minute or switches tab or minimizes browser when user becomes active moves mouse or tab becomes visible again every 3 seconds loop resumes if you get chance please try out let me know what you think,0
but i think its too late change now by now there are users who rely on pinging un pauses check behavior thats too bad i suppose ill update script then another thing you can do toggle off notifications integrations are automatically configured in api v1 checks call if its toggled off manually would just enabled again next api call so its not possible on per check basis with automatic setup unfortunately,0
there link some more detailed documentation on how do things like logging in as super user django administration at  added note about readme customizing email templates have not looked into you can of course just fork repo edit templates but then youll have do some merging going forward there might better way do possibly writing web hooks with variable in them can you please open separate issue for im guessing interesting variables would checks status up down its name code i have pretty sophisticaed python application i callnotification central currently takes rest api commands in allows you pick which services you want send notification out through pushover pushbullet email growl xbmc kodi sms via google voice of twilio etc allows you send in title subject message priorityselection code choose which if not multiple of services youd like notifications go out out as takes inputs from http api can also take inputs as if was growl node cool thats type of application i added webhooks support for if we need post more data make integration useful well do also there way block people from making new registrations not at moment what use case are you thinking of how would i switch backup mysql from postgres i updated readme with details on exactly type of solution i ve been looking for good stuff happy hear,0

hi caleb15 does not set schedules automatically  each check starts with 1 day period 1 hour grace time by default up user adjust schedule however if you clone create copy check schedule copied over if you duplicate checks via api as suggested here then schedule also gets copied over or could have been your colleague adjusting schedules btw there feature request suggest grace time based on observed data but hasnt been implemented yet would suggestion only not applied automatically,0

orange color currently used indicate in grace period status rules are if any matching check down badge red otherwise if any matching check in grace period badge orange otherwise badge green badges have svg json versions we cannot easily change behaviour of svg badges because people are already relying on their current behaviour we can however add more fields in json ones say instead of returning status down return few more fields status down up 15 grace 0 down 1 on status page side you could then fetch json format as badge or dashboard widget locally how does sound,0

ah ok makes sense as long as s not buried in code somewhere where cause problem ill just leave commented out as i am using mariadb thanks on dec 13 2016 at 2 43 pm pteris caune wrote psycopg2 python library for accessing postgresql database if youre using mysql or mariadb then you dont need you can indeed safely comment out not affect anything on ubuntu you can install psycopg2 system wide with apt get install python psycopg2 or apt get install python3 psycopg2 if you install with pip inside virtualenv you need have few dev packages apt get install build essential libpq dev iirc you are receiving because you authored thread reply email directly view on github or mute thread,0

good stuff transport subclass gets instantiated in hc api models channel transport method heres how actual sending of notifications works manage py sendalerts management command running continuously looking for any checks changing state when finds one looks up check instance calls its send alert method check send alert loops through all assigned channels calls notify on each channel notify instantiates correct transport subclass calls its notify method subclass then makes http request or sends email im not familiar with matrix protocol am just starting poke around what do you think about following flow 1 initial setup server admin wants enable matrix integration on their server server admin sets up bot account on their preferred matrix server for example i admin of just set up user account on matrix org server admin puts bot account credentials server url username password or access token if its long lived  not sure in local settings py 2 adding matrix integration account user wants set up matrix notification in their account they invite their matrix room next they copy rooms identifier xxxxx server tld thingy paste in integration details form in their account upon receiving room identifier server accepts invite stores identifier 3 sending matrix notification server wants send notification configured matrix room knows room identifier has its access key from local settings py so sending notification one simple http request does make sense can work if you know of other web apps have integrated matrix what flow do they use my understanding thanks federation would enough for server admin create single bot account on one matrix server,0

my hunch you have both django 2 x django 3 intalled in different locations these are somehow getting mixed up if you use virtualenv maybe you have django installed both globally inside virtualenv my app containerized so these steps are taking place during build process as i mentioned earlier when i run pip3 install r requirements txt installs django 2 2 8 as defined here then when i run pip3 install django auth ldap simply installs django 3 0 on top of without pip uninstalling django which i believe leading error,0
if roll back revision 63b10b40ce585ddbf04161730294bca6ec0a4a92 everything works fine,0
still havent managed reproduce theres bit in traceback you posted file usr lib python3 7 site packages django contrib admin templatetags admin static py line 5 in admin static py file does not exist in django 3 only exists in django 2 x supposed throw deprecation warning my hunch you have both django 2 x django 3 intalled in different locations these are somehow getting mixed up if you use virtualenv maybe you have django installed both globally inside virtualenv ive also sometimes had manually remove outdated pyc files  but if pip installation goes cleanly pip should have taken care of i think,0
my main issue not being able do get object or 404 at start of function yeah on python side doesnt look as elegant as get object or 404 for sure but alternative has drawbacks too needs database migration add column needs data migration populate new column for existing checks needs code populate for all future checks checks table becomes 40 bytes wider database now has do bit more work every time updating row in checks table if unique key column not indexed database still has iterate over multiple rows though would now done inside database not in python code id like start with naive approach revisit if performance starts become problem,0
i think ive fixed hackedbellini can you please try again,0
commit 62310a5 greatly improves overview i like seeing count in top navigation menu as well,0
concretely not at moment but would trivial when well need thank you for all,0
well i needed create super user but admin login still doest work with signs into empty account fyi super user email must not exist in db otherwise there nice 500 error page after login you need manually update auth user table in sqlite cli admin creator doesnt complain learnt hard way,0
scratch unsubscribe link already there i had forgotten about,0
solved sendalerts issue email now send root cause was i did not know then mandatory integration setup,0
yep fixed can confirm updates are now being sent through discord email thanks man,0
seems make sense though passing unique key without having use query string would cleaner if its possible without reinventing wheel ill have think about some options post back with some ideas unless someone comes up with one first,0
when i added paused status use case i had in mind was sometimes check in prolonged maintenance technically down but acknowledged understood so speak in these cases we dont want show red down icons in dashboards in email reports we dont want users develop notification blindness somethings red thats fine somethings always red i had not thought about case where check flapping between up down in case indeed would make sense have separate overriding paused flag but i think its too late change now by now there are users who rely on pinging un pauses check behavior in case i could skip start ping fail checks if check paused another thing you can do toggle off notifications way if check flapping between up down states at least you not spammed with notifications,0
sorry  its undocumented at moment i wanted expose few service wide metrics used in status page i didnt want world public so added metrics key environment value if client specifies correct key they get response otherwise they get 403 i mentioned in changelog but didnt document are you interested in instance wide metrics or per project metrics,0
seeing similar have two checks are down dont seem working seeing following when i try manually wget o dev null 2016 08 19 16 29 29 resolving hchk io 2604 a880 800 10 170d 6001 104 236 126 203 connecting hchk io|2604 a880 800 10 170d 6001| 443 connected http request sent awaiting response 400 bad request 2016 08 19 16 29 29 error 400 bad request,0
hi great thank you for reply i got working im new django apps so im kinda slow in setting up im gonna start setting checks let you know if i face any challenges,0
coverage increased +0 2 86 369 when pulling afe4ec6 on umitakkaya master into 1bae89e on master,0
thanks i see take into consideration as workaround you could move 7 23 constraint your code for example configure hourly cron job runs 00 24 but inside your script change do something ping if hour = 7 hour = 23 do something ping not ideal but would get around issue for now,0
idea behind login links was save hassle of setting up another account for users work of implementing usual signup password storage forgot password bits in app login links avoid some of refreshing inbox fishing for correct email with link of course annoying if required done often i think would less of issue if you only needed log in every few months you would already logged in most of time in long run might make sense set up more traditional user account creation implement team access in short term would help increase cookie expiration times so you stay logged in for longer,0
im not planning support for multiple overlapping start finish cycles for single check for tracking concurrent job execution i would recommend one of create new check via api for each job delete check once job completes successfully or have single check gets pinged every time job completes check triggers alert if no jobs have finished for too long use separate logging or apm system for tracking detailed debug information,0
ok,0
thanks good idea honest with only 30 checks in my personal account i dont have good grasp on what pain points are for heaviest users so feedback like very welcome ive been thinking about how would implemented without major changes current sorting ui im leaning towards always showing failed checks at top any failed check should priority fix or pause or remove if its obsolete showing them at top would emphasize for example if user has selected sorting by name then we first show all failed checks in z order we then show all remaining checks in z order list of checks also being auto refreshed using ajax requests i think would confusing for table rows jump around when checks change status so i would avoid doing keep initial order until page reloaded,0
m42e sorry saw your comment then forgot about since its closed ticket tricky problem initially only had simple checks no start endpoint late status made perfect sense now with cron schedules with start events meaning of late lot murkier i now sort of wish i had implemented start in very simple limited way store last start timestamp use calculate execution time on finish nothing more  dont display started status in dashboard dont interfere with badges dont send alert if start isnt followed by regular ping on time of course its too late now change drop features also i suspect if had just simple there would feature requests show started status in dashboard send alerts when started check hanging for too long i do agree orange late badge for started checks not ideal more likely interpreted as we have small problem instead of all well for now but one or more checks may or may not go down soon let started not alterok status option theres related problem with checks with cron expressions lets say cron expression 0 at minute 0 of every hour in reality job takes some time run so reports in at minute 2 3 of every hour as result for few minutes at start of every hour badge would show late although everything working as expected maybe we should just get rid of late status for badges  make so badge can only ever up or down late would count as up,0

cuu508 im sure im on wrong one but we have issue with archive downloaded by i created issue galexrt docker 28 i created super user i get page when loggin now,0
what im planning do get rid of stopped state suppose you have multiple channels set up lets say email slack webhook webhook url obviously invalid because of copy pasting mishap what happens currently first time we try posting slack fail we mark check as paused give up forever even though email channel might still viable useful what i think should happen check never goes into paused state if posting channel fails we store most recent failure message display on channels page add note about in monthly report etc failures might also temporary worth retrying later,0

thanks for suggestion im thinking of two scenarios where might useful your cron job runs as should say once hour but youve set up period grace parameters incorrectly say once day its not huge issue except for when check actually goes down take longer 23 hours until you find out in situation warning in dashboard possibly in monthly report would sufficient your period grace parameters are set up correctly but something changes on cron side job e g looping infinitely pinging on each iteration in case we would want proactive send notification which one did you have in mind any ideas on how distinguish between two,0

hi guys im guessing you are using codebase for coding exercises  cool if you write tests for areas with currently no test coverage ill happy review merge,0
currently we cannot signal failure via email but im open implementing i want run ui mockup past you ask few questions see if its any good looking at ui do you think would your solve your use case what do you expect happen if both keyword text boxes are empty what do you expect happen if only success keyword filled what do you expect happen if only failure keyword filled in case there isnt specific timing for emails so ignore filter cant really help with are emails coming in at random intervals you want any success email flip check green any failure email flip red,0
yes bit of unique case but i have as script runs sends healthcheck ping times influx db grafana for charting jobs their health over time would nice if i could expose link each jobs chart without having view details screen these links are derived from jobs name or id description exposes url as clickable link but i can only view by clicking through details page or if when you click on job get edit window if description was rendered out instead of editable initially click edit button turn into textarea then would expose description as well,0
im trying run project in domain+folder combo like one without success in my local settings py there are among others site root = static url = css js loads fine but still in template urls are falling back like accounts login in html which results ending up at i thought of setting tag but doesnt affect links starting with slash so i also tried injecting small js tag replacing all href form action attributes which also feels hacky incomplete some minified js file still omits oh i also tried inject some python code into hc urls py file prepend all urls with k8s but didnt work way app becomes available at which also not what i want echo e nurlpatterns = path k8s include urlpatterns app hc urls py entry point of my kubernetes cluster at path managed by ambassador so apps root should at only starts receive http requests below point by way my dockerfile from if helps anything but i dont think issue with app works fine just links generated on frontend are problematic what do you suggest what more should i try effectively change base path without too many source code hacks,0

needs rebase couple of changes but otherwise nice minimal fix thanks,0
as mentioned in email i think we should separate speed dial from top sites for couple of reasons what defines top sites fact more visited sites bubble top so having default sites pinned top doesnt really match use case for panel im concerned about having locale checks being embedded in various parts of data source as makes much harder debug by introducing more code branches follow alternative approach we can take extract locale checks from topsitespanel into homepanels swift where we configure which panels show here we can slot in new speed dialer panel without impacting other locales subclass topsitespanel for speeddialer implement logic for keeping tiles at top ideally we would refactor topsitespanel into more generic tiled panel class but we can address when we start adding additional functionality dialer thoughts,0
sync would write into loginsm but speaking more generally  triggers are pretty granular we dont do all of syncs work in single transaction so youd get n change notifications during sync also youd need register c callback function into sql use triggers which bit of pain much easier just have sqlitelogins expose little change tracking notification thing,0
extra parameters like style=trailhead required too see stomlinson for details,0

hey brian thanks for checking out was removing translucent effect in url bar intentional just wanted sure since i dont see any comments in bug about change ah no wasnt i guess expected behavior area behind location bar should display content below blurred using effects view its wrapped in right do we want fade dark gray in landscape orientation makes sense in portrait since we re transitioning dark url bar but in landscape feels out of place since theres nothing dark fade into hmm ya does feel out of place when just fading out those elements i can revert same animation we had before where we faded out entire urlbarview darrinhenein any thoughts i noticed url bar doesnt immediately start fading away if i scroll from top of page i have scroll small distance first we should probably start scrolling from top like we did before like safari does i think being caused by miscalculation on my part ill update scroll right away scrolling bottom causes page jitter get stuck aw chucks let me investigate,0

i can see searchsettingstableviewcontroller clearprivatedatatableviewcontroller becoming subclasses of settingstableviewcontroller in general i think any settings page shares similar look feel as main settings of app would subclasses of settingstableviewcontroller for any new options require custom layout its pretty easy slot in as another setting subclass way any custom work we do for particular screen easily transferable other settings screen if we need in other words i see settingstableviewcontroller being part of our toolkit we can share with ux team when comes designing new settings screens from existing designs looks like there common theme them creating subclass allow us easily map ux requirements code,0

sleroux thanks for review i thought about doing but output would little bit different from current scenario for example doing way you suggested which i agree best fade out animation on table view cell would start at same moment user tapped cell meaning user would see cell animating deselected state i e tap see select cell animation see deselect animation while next screen animating i did other way because i didnt want do since all other cells are always selected until user get back tableview i e tap see select cell animation see next screen animation its minor difference but i didnt wanted change behavior should i do another pr with your suggestion close one thanks again for your input,0

urgh having shared cursor between searchviewcontroller url bar turned into much bigger ordeal than i had hoped for one we were using pull data source model for autocompletetextfield where text field would query its data source for domains doesnt mix well with sharing query since we have two separate functions trigger queries didtextchange suggestionfortext theres really no good way combine them so svc query domain query can happen in same callback i had jiggle autocompletetextfield implementation push based killing off autocompletetextfielddatasource callback replacing with setautocompletesuggestion function also doesnt make much sense for svc pass back domain autocompletion results svc doesnt do anything with these domains so putting implementation there just because already has cursor kind of hack in end seemed better go opposite direction pull cursor out of svc into shared loader can push data svc url bar loader logic handle simple enough though i needed these first 4 patches of cleanup minor refactoring get work,0

if screen state has noop another state b or action then you can goto without going b if you ask goto b from then nothing visible happen on screen what if you are in b you say goto would know = b when noop specified in only or should i specifiy noop in bs state description as well i just realized regarding screenaction my confusion came from declaration in map addscreenstate browsertab example above screenstate gesture foraction action loadurlbytyping action loadurl so means following set of actions defines action loadurlbytyping leads action loadurl action right if so would make more clear if we have parameter between like old objective c like maybe syntax deprecated now screenstate gesture foraction action loadurlbytyping action loadurl can you give me some examples where might useful now i have better understanding of what screenaction does no wont necessary also would nice if we can set dismissonuse as part of userstate there may cases where going back possible but really you shouldnt can you give me some examples where might useful if never advisable then should you just not wire together like i was thinking about case where screengraph decides going back optimal path for example b c i want go e screengraph decides c b e faster than c d1 d2 d3 e but going back b change state but youre right i guess in case its simpler outline paths e rather than having additional logic inside screengraph for error strings i was thinking about something even simpler like if im in state want go b using action c should give me error messages when action c fails for whatever reason error message should output exact ui action failed like could not go state b because ui action x failed last successful ui action was y without adding error checks directly into state definitions but in past weeks i noticed already implemented for most part would nice if had more details like last successful action but not absolutely needed,0

argee88 sebastianwolf sap as one of projects developers actually concluded correctly everything needed said was said opinion cant utterly wrong if development team using software frameworks or apis constrained by vendor simply not possible ship software environments where fundamental software code application relies on not bundled with if there was viable way of providing support for older phones especially oss therefore increasing potential audience help detect infection chains obviously application would target oldest earliest possible deployment target but again not case here if you do not have background in software engineering dont understand i can give you real life analogy just ping me again richardbrammer on side note i personally dont expect apple ship software update for ios 12 or earlier deliver these apis there several reasons why seems unlikely keep things organized i vote for keeping ticket closed until there valid reason reopen how situation with android i expect being worse as hardware manufacturers like tamper with stock android before releasing their devices android hardware half life tends shorter than these of ios devices in general,0

sebastianwolf sap thank you for explanation only reason i considered forking get translated because i was expecting state already close final due publicly promised release at least thats what i heard in media within month some people stated its not necessary hav emore languages i just care about official public first which announced big which cause first wave of users installing thats when app should already translated several languages or otherwise acceptance rates too low i pretty sure about from previous experience your answer sounds more like current progress isnt close releasable state though things are still quite in flux in case of course i agree its not right time for translations yet i think translations should added 1 2 weeks before planned final release or in case beta phase planned alongside first beta also as long as youre having plans actually support more languages than just current two in first public im happy wait for right time not create fork which would only make things worse manage thank you for more detailed answer sorry for my impatience,0
maku1303 14 14 does not count as stuck your risiko ermittlung was just active for entire last 14 days we are currently working on making screen clearer but if you see does not change anymore everything working as expected slage16 11 14 days can stay for couple of days depending on which days in past app was deactivated as example today you have 11 14 day exposure logging was deactivated for last 3 days then would take 11 days until you see change as only then deactivation from 3 days ago would no longer in last 14 days window see for more details corona warn app cwa app android 796 comment for detailed breakdown,0

if developers not react comment within next 2 days i guess we should inform media sites app basically disfunctional you are of course free inform whoever you see fit about issue but keep in mind app only facing issues in small set of edge cases we are already investigating issue as visible by assigned status we have other issues with higher priority e g unexpected error codes from system which we have investigate together with apple i think there misunderstanding about scope of bug not only happening in small number if edge cases but for every single device i checked i think in first days some users maybe opened app sometimes manually because s something new interesting but most users just install app ans not check regularly for these which we can guess big majority app does not work they not get warning about any exposure let me clarify my original bug report ids get updated if app remains open even in ebackground but they dont if app remains closed thats point,0

723 comment would highly interesting have dashboard with statistics included how many contacts you had during day total per hour number of cell phones with bluetooth number of cell phones with corona warn app also view shows how many contacts you had within special duration histogram 1m 5m 10m 15m 15m,0
i made same observation update iphone 7plus ios 13 6 start corona warn app everything fine dont start app any more periodically check begegnungs berpr fung no updates manually starting app today at 08 30 before update 13 6 everything works fine i have made screenshot of battery status no background activity shown for app,0

i think high percentage because there no other app running in time period covid 19 kontaktprotokoll implemented by apple we give feedback back apple improve behavior in future sure percentage depends on activities by other apps relative however one can try estimate what means in absolute numbers in my case battery drained from 100 15 in 24h 85 multiplying with 26 relative usage of warn app + covid 19 exposure logging translates absolute 22 battery drain within 24 hours might issue if one has no possibility recharge phone for longer period,0

please add your observations 759 where error 11 13 handled issue should only about error 2 thanks,0
error occurs when api gets called often in internal defined time frame so there has breakpoint where hook up function gets into loop calling framework or wrong condition leading multiple calls related error code 13 rate limited makes sense error occurred now not earlier because today was first time app actually called api check matching key identifiers chk code did app accessed framework you can check under settings app privacy health covid 19 exposure logging underactive apps there grey text where you can see number of times framework was accessed underexposure checks you can also get json output of check so you can see if access was successful,0
furthermore ihre should capitalised if im not mistaken ihre third person plural here therefore i dont think should capitalised,0

we could exclude certificate pinning for debugging builds or disable using another scheme i think excluding certificate pinning for builds using enacommunity scheme would make sense would not require adding another scheme i dont think there way get any development build endusers app needs distributed through app store or test flight which in both cases trigger review at apple entitlement use exposure notification app also locked sap so no other developer could even build working app uses exposure notification api community build just mocks api enable other developers using fastlane should even make sure no development build gets submitted app store by accident,0

small update from our side other officially supported languages beyond english german most certainly come much earlier than expected not for first but straight afterwards once final list of officially supported languages you wont disappointed most certainly there we publish list also ask you all if there are additional ones which you would like have supported could translate choose one or two kick start work on community translation process point we still have quite some things clarify as many ui texts especially privacy notice eula related things are legally binding documents so they need 100 correct but im quite confident we find solution more updates follow as soon as we have them thanks colleagues mit freundlichen gr en best regards sw corona warn app open source team,0

bigger concern at point big pr push about app nearly over when app finally available downloaded by people on other app stores how everyone know try again its not like everyone get notification newspapers etc wont publish story of hey try downloading app again actually makes topic quite urgent longer takes more hurts adoption which directly challenges goals of project,0
intended behavior yesterday first day package from server became available thats why you see only one entry from yesterday today second package became available every 24 hours app feeds all available day packages from last 14 days into exposure notification framework because we need calculate overall risk from all keys have been submitted within relevant timeframe,0

yes all screens should adjusted in due course but avoid major merge conflicts i would prefer have one merged first then gradually apply properties every screen what do you think i tend disagree on i would agree if there would one pr coming right after one where all screens adapted imo opening more prs for potentially even more than 5 at stage its too late for also theres story make button adapt nicely larger fonts ideally we should open max 2 prs for each individual story one for implementation one for adoption or do everything in one pr,0

i think you highly overestimate percentage of people who even semi regularly shutdown reboot their phone might maybe i m not average user offtopic however whole usage of app way too low for several reasons currently there are around 8000 confirmed active infections in germany just 300 of them used app get code for sure does not consider demographics or familiy constellations etc,0

since yesterday first diagnosis keys are available now however my app has not updated since yesterday morning my exposure log has not been checked so whole day i was not warned of possible exposures could possibly have infected many more people after release of new keys checks should triggered as soon as possible which not possible with fetch background mode gives app execution time at irregular intervals only only very rarely if app not actively used either apple can make exception for corona warn apps schedule execution more often or silent push notifications would appropriate would allow checks carried out promptly which i urgently consider necessary here as interim solution there way trigger exposure check each time app started or at least manually hi i m having same issue i installed app 8 days ago my exposure log wasnt checked yet,0
main problem here any dev certificate other than one from sap dev team does not have required entitlements build sign app with release schema =version downloadable in appstore contains hook up for en framework so you cannot build same app home compare hashes or do other comparisons simplest thing just analyze binarys thats not difficult concerns from people without any tech experience should ignored as you cannot counter them with any technical proofs they always exist,0

conclusion when user first starts app in introduction screens should told explicitly user has enable bluetooth cellular data every time he goes outside so app can work without chances of many people not using app right are huge because app does tell you when opening but user won t open app frequently i would also add both bluetooth options are just fine turning bluetooth completely on blue symbol on my iphone se partly deactivating white symbol for me important topic i do not want have my bluetooth on all time i mostly use partly off mode as far as i understood mode completely enough for corona app,0

dear m1ga thank your very much for your contribution project team working tirelessly on getting app ready in time working on many backlog items in parallel also means some implementations cannot done yet as we are for example waiting for final decisions from design team therefore we unfortunately have reject your corresponding pr for now avoid situation in future please open issue for your fixes wait until team assigns you issue we further create issues with community label which you can claim by commenting on them dont have wait for assignment thank you for your understanding,0

hei we have some things we might need some support with stypox implemented exposure risk calculation algoritm coralibre coralibre android sdk 24 he has question regarding calculation of transmissionrisklevel which we cant answer right now maltej maybe you have idea about his question also we currently face task of testing algorithm we dont have access official testing vectors so we thought we might test by sending different tek rpis into original cwa app our algorithm check if output equal i thought way we could do was use xposed framework hock function calls calculation of exposure risk however we cant wait for someone get corona able test so we also have inject fake tek rpi pairs into app what do you think there simpler solution maltej could you guys test our algorithm for us instead would someone want help us with testing framework,0
personally i disagree with risiko ermittlung rather risikoermittlung change might however still conform though,0
only benefit would less code i checked your reference code again helper class about 70 loc without tests like you mentioned however i currently do not need any helper class in volley induce json request thus error potential here higher when we switch okhttp since i do not need rely on helper regarding your initial comment maybe little bit more supporting both json protbuf implementing general error classification system i agree needs done specifically error classification system however should aligned also with general exception handling method we use in our application currently still wip as mentioned in our docs maybe as additional context regarding classes we use for building requests we decided use explicit requestclasses for our most important http calls more explicit about our call structure but not yet final could change regarding asynchronous calls reducing complexity we do not need do asnychrouse calls than synchronize them with suspendcoroutine continuation any more i tend disagree here as your call referencing your helper class just makes http call synchronous we would thus need rely on another way of spreading requests on our threadmodel still wrap actual calls with something like fork system or queue like currently implemented in fact if i look at snippet of your helper you use client newcall request execute method which in fact synchronous as you can see in okhttp docs only way do my knowledge right now maybe i missed something in okhttp asynchronously in fact by using callbacks which would then just like now wrapped in coroutine suspends itself i rather reference android native implementation than okhttp some own coding here honest we can switch okhttpstack in case of security issues down line as base handler we thus do not limit ourselves at moment all in all i see more complexity in stage of project by introducing your change because we need add helper functions thread managing code still use blocking requests down line in way you proposed all while still needing tests for actual purpose of calls as always open for feedback thanks jakob edit regarding usage of both json protobuf we mainly use protobuf because of its advantages in payload sizes on big key packages e g on key files we use json for smaller requests in general there exception regarding app configuration because comes from distribution service,0

hman2 actually considered way too expensive see corona warn app ziemlich teuer its open secret corona warn app just bailout for german companies whole point why every european country doing its own app instead of european joint development now governments can spend 27 times money instead of only once they just want have reason give taxpayers money industry thats if you understood then i think absolutely legit ask something in return for i think supporting open source exposure api would great way spend all excessive tax payers cash especially since long term goal of many german strategists become independent from us companies alternative open source exposure api working on lineageos or similar w o google services would very well fit into strategy summarize sap got way too much cash from german government very important economic political social goal become independent from us companies now we just need someone with great vision manager who does not just look at monthly cash flows but at long term well being of company then absolutely clear sap telekom must support thescrabi his colleges create something independent from big us companies,0
ah nice so tl dr badly accumulated about measuring distance there value called attenuations used as proxy for distance of two devices its calculated with formula attenuation = tx power rssi measured + rssi correction whereas tx power transmission power rssi receiving power in order measure persistent rssi across different devices each device needs calibrated thats no problem because google hands out cvs file with calibrations for different devices which apparently constantly updated link snaptshot how calculate use clibration rather less interesting for us i guess unless we want contribute devices calibration list scan duration devices scan every 5min for 4 seconds handling duplicates if capture scanned multiple times all captures are saved whereas minimum average attenuation stored note for me save all calculate average later duplicates across multiple scanns if you scan rpis once scan same rpis or rpis belong same tek five minutes later put all of these into exposureinformation gets important for risk calculation keywoard exposure duration disclaimer please correct me if assumed something wrong,0

if youre such fan ob singletons then i guess singleton factories would make too at end what dagger2 generates but dependency injection testing necessary for quality assurance especially in project like di framework at end just detail but you need get rid of singleton calls or you wont have testable code at all,0

ok maybe bailout bit too strong translation of industrief rderung but i think you get idea do not forget measuring distances with bluetooth nothing bluetooth was built for results are highly dependant on antenna gain emission characteristics casing etc pp et al no one has done before so had tested deeply because least government would want are high rates of false negative or false positive results for testing app they called for armed forces of germany well but all was not part of app has all been developed by google corona app developed here just front end graphical user interface for some google service app receives exposure notification events from google api which does all complex underlying mechanics then writes event into database besides provides nice graphics user thats basically so if your assumption was all of underlying mechanics have been developed by sap telekom you think 20 million absolutely reasonable price then yes i agree but point they charged full development price for just developing hull thats what i criticize why i think fair ask supporting development of free open source exposure api,0
